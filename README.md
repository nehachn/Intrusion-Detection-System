# Intrusion-Detection-System
This repository contains different approaches that I used to build an Intrusion Detection System for Cyber-Physical Systems using Machine Learning

# Dataset
The Dataset used while building Intrusion Detection model is Secure Water Treatment(SWat) Dataset. The SWaT dataset comprises of reading from the sensors and actuators of an operational water treatment testbed, at different timestamp. The testbed comprises of 6 different stages, where each stage signifies a water treatment process. The physical parameters that are measured by the sensors are level of the water in the tanks, differential pressure, flow indicators etc. The actuators are different kind of valves that can either be ON or OFF.

# Target
While making Intrusion Detection Model I have tried to answer following questions as well - 
1. Why do we need machine learning for intrusion detection ?				
2. Which one works better: supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised ?  
I have implemented supervised and unsupervised approach and compared their results which can be seen in [Results.pdf](https://github.com/nehachn/Intrusion-Detection-System/blob/main/Results.pdf)
